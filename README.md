I'm **Ara Adkins**, a compiler and runtime developer, and type-theorist with a
passion for formal verification. I love to work on UX, performance, and enabling
better and safer software through type systems and verification. I also work on
cryptographic systems and machine learning from time to time, and have a passion
for computer graphics and simulation.

In my spare time, I run an audio engineering business doing mixing and mastering
in the music industry. I also love to make things of all kinds, and to ski,
sail, and practice parkour and martial arts. I also like to go trail wheeling in
my car!

### ðŸ’» Projects

Listed below are a few of the major projects that I am or have been involved
with that I'm proud of. The public ones are linked.

- **[Lampe](https://github.com/reilabs/lampe):** Formalising the semantics of
  Noir in Lean so we can reason about the correctness of Noir programs with a
  focus on UX and usability for non-professionals trying their hand at
  verification.
- **Lagrange:** A dependently-typed programming language with dependent,
  polymorphic row types used to give it the flexibility of dynamically-typed
  systems.
- **REPLive:** A Swiss Army Knife of computation for your pocket or your wrist.
  This project aims to make computing on the go as easy and intuitive as it can
  be.
- [**Recursion Music:**](https://iamrecursion.com) Mixing and mastering in a
  custom-built studio.
